# unified-docker-builder

This repository has been archived. The builder image factory is now a part of the main [nwnxee/unified](https://github.com/nwnxee/unified/blob/master/builder.Dockerfile) repository and docker images are built through GitHub actions.

The instructions for building your own image as described below have not changed.

# Run

```
git clone https://github.com/nwnxee/unified.git
cd unified
./Scripts/rundockerbuild.sh
```

For further details see the nwnxee [README](https://github.com/nwnxee/unified#compiling-nwnxee-docker).
